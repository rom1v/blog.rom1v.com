    Salute,

    Tu comptes publier un article en Français ? Je l'aurai bien remonté sur le
    Journal du hacker. Pour envoyer des SMS c'est très simple/pratique ou il
    faut avoir envie et faire des efforts selon toi ?

    Thanks ha ha, Tcho !

    J'avais hésité, mais finalement je ne vais pas publier en français: ça
    demande trop de travail d'écrire les articles en double.

    Je ne suis pas sûr d'avoir compris ta question sur les SMS. Moi, je
    trouve plus pratique de les écrire avec le clavier du PC.

    Thanks for the app. Looks good and fast, but I can't get edge-swiping to
    work, which limits usability quite a bit. Likewise no pinch-zoom. Hope to
    see these in a future iteration.

    @Louie, I don't know if it's specific to Windows 10 but the first time I
    started the app it appeared not to work either. In my case the debugging
    mode trust dialog appeared on my phone but nothing happened after allowing
    the connection. Executing the app again worked but it spawned a duplicate
    process on my computer (CTRL+ALT+DEL -> Task Manager -- didn't know which
    one was the good one so I killed both). It appears to be working fine now.

    @Romain, nice work! Thanks for opening the source! I haven't checked the
    code yet but maybe there's an issue when connecting the phone in debugging
    mode for the first time on an untrusted computer?

    It seems like the issue (or at least a very similar one) has already been
    submitted (Issue #9). I've replicated the problem on another computer, so
    I've added this info as a comment to the existing issue.

    Thanks!

    Great work! Have you thought about mentioning it on
    https://www.xda-developers.com/ ?

    Other thing. I've learnt about haven't and (forgive me) I haven't tried it
    your app yet, but from:

    > It is possible to execute Java code as shell on Android, by invoking
    > app_process from adb shell.

    and given that it's possible to run adb over the network (adb connect device
    over TCP port 5555), I'm inclined to think that it would possible to run
    your app without having the droid physically connected over USB, which in
    turn would make your app a really good remote support app. If you see what I
    mean.

    Whoa, if it supported audio, and coupled with a Raspberry Pi and a
    touchscreen, this would make a killer car head unit!

    I'm sick of Android Auto being a walled garden and only the Google-vetted

    First of all, a huge thanks to the developer for this solution. I've been
    looking for something like this for a while. Most of the solutions i found
    had a substantial lag(my 2nd Pentium made it worse).
    But this works smoothest and startup is fast too...Thanks again!

    One thing I'm unable to figure out is, how to use navigation
    keys(Back,Home,Recents) in scrcpy, as my device have H/w keys

    Congratulations for your creation. I have been looking for something similar
    (vysor, samsung sidesync) but nothing compares to this in simplicity and
    speed. Nothing (only adb drivers) to install on computer and phone and it
    works, that's what I call sleek.

    The new mouse shorcuts are very convenient, I like them! And for file
    transfer I can just use the plain usb connection.

    Regarding issues found: keyboard is also working with samsung keyboard.
    Seems something google keyboard specific.
    Also vol+ and vol- keyboard shorcuts doesn't work (on lineageos 14/samsung
    nougat)

    Keep up the good work! My whishlist: Audio routed to the computer. I'm
    unable to help but I know that android has a mode where it behaves as a
    player that can route audio back through usb and get play/pause/stop
    commands. It is called (I believe) accessory mode

    I've had a chance to try out scrcpy and I like it quite a lot. Do you know
    if it is feasible to have the devices screen off while streaming the video
    to the desk? I feel like this might not be possible but it would be nice for
    conserving the device battery.

    IMO, turning device screen off [is not possible][reddit-screen-off].

    You could change the [brightness], though (using a wrapper script).
