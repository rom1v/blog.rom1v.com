    @Louie, I don't know if it's specific to Windows 10 but the first time I
    started the app it appeared not to work either. In my case the debugging
    mode trust dialog appeared on my phone but nothing happened after allowing
    the connection. Executing the app again worked but it spawned a duplicate
    process on my computer (CTRL+ALT+DEL -> Task Manager -- didn't know which
    one was the good one so I killed both). It appears to be working fine now.

    @Romain, nice work! Thanks for opening the source! I haven't checked the
    code yet but maybe there's an issue when connecting the phone in debugging
    mode for the first time on an untrusted computer?

    Great work! Have you thought about mentioning it on

    Other thing. I've learnt about haven't and (forgive me) I haven't tried it
    your app yet, but from:

    > It is possible to execute Java code as shell on Android, by invoking
    > app_process from adb shell.

    and given that it's possible to run adb over the network (adb connect device
    over TCP port 5555), I'm inclined to think that it would possible to run
    your app without having the droid physically connected over USB, which in
    turn would make your app a really good remote support app. If you see what I
    mean.

    Congratulations for your creation. I have been looking for something similar
    (vysor, samsung sidesync) but nothing compares to this in simplicity and
    speed. Nothing (only adb drivers) to install on computer and phone and it
    works, that's what I call sleek.

    The new mouse shorcuts are very convenient, I like them! And for file
    transfer I can just use the plain usb connection.

    Regarding issues found: keyboard is also working with samsung keyboard.
    Seems something google keyboard specific.
    Also vol+ and vol- keyboard shorcuts doesn't work (on lineageos 14/samsung
    nougat)

    Keep up the good work! My whishlist: Audio routed to the computer. I'm
    unable to help but I know that android has a mode where it behaves as a
    player that can route audio back through usb and get play/pause/stop
    commands. It is called (I believe) accessory mode

    IMO, turning device screen off [is not possible][reddit-screen-off].

    You could change the [brightness], though (using a wrapper script).

    I have experienced only one issue -- which involves "swiping up" when the

    FYI, _scrcpy_ should be listening on the port for about 1 second, so
    unless you want to start several devices in the same second, you should
    be able to run several _scrcpy_ instances without using a custom port.

    I went looking for a replacement to SideSync on my S9, since it isn't
    supported and Flow is terrible by comparison.  I stumbled upon this and it
    is fantastic!

    There are a couple of things that I still miss like the notifications from
    my phone on my PC, easy file transferring, automatic screen dimming or
    turning off the screen completely, etc., but it is still much, much better
    than Flow and other mirroring options.

    If anyone is interested, I used Tasker to turn the brightness to zero and
    keep the phone awake when charging when charging via USB (i.e. connected to
    my computer) and near my computer's bluetooth address.  My S9 using scrcpy
    actually charges faster than my S7 did using SideSync, even though SideSync
    was able to completely turn the screen off!

    [@AntinioBray](#comment-52) The main latency is due to encoding/decoding.
    Thus, to improve it, you need to encode and decode faster. One possibility
    is simply to reduce the definition (`scrcpy -m800`).

    This software is brilliant! Apart from I cannot view the unlock by pin
    screen when I slide up it just shows a black screen but if I look at the
    phone it displays correctly.

    [@daddy366](#comment-56) If you have this error on devices having at least
    Android 5 (it is expected to fail on [Android 4]), please open an [issue].
    Also check whether `adb logcat` provide more details about the error.

    [Android 4]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/98
    [issue]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues

    [@Nathan](#comment-58) Maybe your lock screen [protects the screen].

    You are a life saver, my touchscreen has been failing in random intervals
    lately, i tried with other solutions but they were uncomfortable to use and
    sold your data plus were expensive or heavily limited

    This has none of that and next to no delay i love it

    Open a while (seconds) then it closes¡¡ (Solved)

    For a wile I had problem whit scrcpy usin in a motorola G4 and lubuntu
    18.04. the problem was when I started scrcpy, and using your sugested
    parameter (`scrcpy -m800 -b2M`), it open as suposed, but when I did click in
    the screen it closes, afther it I did many changes in the size and bit-rate
    and it dosen't worked, so I chosed change the kernel, so instead of continue
    working whit linux 4.15.0-45, I walk back and change to 4.15.0-20, afther
    that change it worked well, I supos that the problem is the driver or other
    kind of that stuff.

    good job. thanks

    Hello,

    merci pour cet utilitaire.

    Je l'ai mis en oeuvre en WiFi de la manière suivante :
    - cible Mi Box S sur moniteur 4K LG
    - modem WiFi câble HD RED
    - hôtes :
      * PC Dell sous Win10
      * PC portable HP sous Debian Stretch

    Les deux cas fonctionnent. A noter qu'avec Oreo 8.1 il n'y a plus besoin de
    faire la commande adb tcpip PORT par l'USB pour utiliser adb et scrcpy par
    WiFI.  Juste pas mal de latence dans le cas de la copie d'affichage vidéo
    (lag). De l'instabilité aussi (ça fige).

    En l'occurrence j'ai testé cet outil pour essayer de piloter à distance ma
    Mi Box (clavier et souris) avec mon vieux PC portable (2006) avec trackpad
    sans acheter une airmouse chinoise à 10 ou 20 USD.  Je ne suis donc pas
    intéressé par la copie d'écran mais uniquement par clavier et souris. Je
    pense qu'une option permettant le contrôle distant par clavier/souris sans
    la copie d'écran serait une chose intéressante.

    Merci encore
