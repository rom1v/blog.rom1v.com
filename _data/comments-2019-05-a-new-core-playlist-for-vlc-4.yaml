    Hi I hope that the new interface will be better with screen readers.
    Please don't break A11Y.

    VLC is one of the very finest pieces of open source software I've ever used.
    It's better than all commercial offerings, and it's superior to all other
    players on linux.  I am puzzled why distribution developers insist on making
    rhythmbox and amarok and all these other media players as the default, when
    they all seem to have serious, STILL unfixed bugs, and it's obvious that VLC
    is superior in every way, from performance to stability. It actually irks
    me, as an end user.  The only reason I can think that they do this is some
    kind of dare I say millenial sense of misplaced undermining of merit under
    the veil of diversity / battling 'anticompetitive' or monopolistic forces of
    being a better product.  In other words, VLC is the BEST and that is why
    young radical socialist minded poeple in the open source community feel the
    need to "create a safe sapce ubuntu so that rhythmbox...which is a terrible
    software by the way and always locks up no matter which computer or system
    across several major ubuntu / debian and mint distros, including even LTS
    distros I use"...they still persist on including it because otherwise Ubuntu
    would be complete and perfect and therefore would beat windows and mac, but
    we don't want taht.  I'm personally tired of people getting in their own way
    as a matter of policy or 'diversity' ethic.  There are some things that are
    better than others.  Everyone should standarize on what's better, and make
    other things that aren't optional.  VLC is better.  The end.  Get over it
    you devs of inferior open source and fix your open source or just abandon
    the project so people will gravitate to the best.   I end up vigorously
    uninstalling these rhythmbox and amarok type programs after trying them for
    5 min and having them lock up the system or some other weird problem.  I
    keep checking to see if they are better.  And they aren't.  VLC had
    instability issues for one version and it was fixed in 2 months, never
    happened again.  I think this was around 2014

    Great article! I work on the queue implementation for a media player app, so
    this article is relevant to my interests.

    Do you think you get much benefit from being multithreaded? Seems to add a
    lot of complexity.

    It blows my mind that someone would call a dynamic array that uses void
    pointers "useless" just because it's not type safe. The type unsafe
    operations can be localized to just a small area of the code. The surface
    area for mistakes with this approach is probably no larger than the surface
    area for bugs in a "type safe" macro implementation.

    And then you went and copied C++ and Rust and called it a "vector", which
    even Bjarne Stroustrup admits was a mistake...

    If you can avoid multithreading here, for example if you can make your
    playlist _live_ in your UI thread, then definitely do it.

    Not really localized, every access, insertion or removal will be "unsafe".
    But IMO this is not a problem in C.

    Do you have a link quoting Stroustrup about `vector` being a mistake?

    VLC is by far the best, the most useful, and the most reliable player for
    linux. After installing, Ubuntu, I uninstall all default players, then I
    install VLC. Without VLC, I don't know what would I do as there is not a
    good player even close to VLC.
