    VLC is one of the very finest pieces of open source software I've ever used.
    It's better than all commercial offerings, and it's superior to all other
    players on linux.  I am puzzled why distribution developers insist on making
    rhythmbox and amarok and all these other media players as the default, when
    they all seem to have serious, STILL unfixed bugs, and it's obvious that VLC
    is superior in every way, from performance to stability. It actually irks
    me, as an end user.  The only reason I can think that they do this is some
    kind of dare I say millenial sense of misplaced undermining of merit under
    the veil of diversity / battling 'anticompetitive' or monopolistic forces of
    being a better product.  In other words, VLC is the BEST and that is why
    young radical socialist minded poeple in the open source community feel the
    need to "create a safe sapce ubuntu so that rhythmbox...which is a terrible
    software by the way and always locks up no matter which computer or system
    across several major ubuntu / debian and mint distros, including even LTS
    distros I use"...they still persist on including it because otherwise Ubuntu
    would be complete and perfect and therefore would beat windows and mac, but
    we don't want taht.  I'm personally tired of people getting in their own way
    as a matter of policy or 'diversity' ethic.  There are some things that are
    better than others.  Everyone should standarize on what's better, and make
    other things that aren't optional.  VLC is better.  The end.  Get over it
    you devs of inferior open source and fix your open source or just abandon
    the project so people will gravitate to the best.   I end up vigorously
    uninstalling these rhythmbox and amarok type programs after trying them for
    5 min and having them lock up the system or some other weird problem.  I
    keep checking to see if they are better.  And they aren't.  VLC had
    instability issues for one version and it was fixed in 2 months, never
    happened again.  I think this was around 2014
