    > In C and C++, infinite loops without side-effects are undefined behavior.

    Actually, in C (unlike C++), such loops are only UB if the loop condition is
    not a constant expression.  However, LLVM fails to implement this exception
    as is thus breaking some correct C programs.  This has been reported against
    LLVM already more than ten years ago:

    Thank you for the precision, I was not aware of this subtlety.

    In the device-to-network direction, on new connection, the received headers
    are [copied to a buffer][packetizer-copy], with source and destination
    swapped, so that they are [updated][packetizer-update] (lengths and checksum
    fields) on each packet built for the network-to-device direction.

    Thanks for good article!

    I'm wondering why you didn't implement `EventListener` trait for `Storage`
    struct from your example with `Observer` pattern? Also, you could change a
    signature of `on_event` method to be

    {% highlight rust %}
    pub trait EventListener {
        fn on_event(&mut self, event: u32);
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

    So, your event listeners are free to mutate their state based on given
    event. `Storage` struct greatly benefit from this design.

    That's an alternative, but it would need to be implemented for
    `Rc<RefCell<Storage>>`.

    That's a good question, I hesitated to talk about it in the article.

    The `Notifier` stores the listeners in a `Vec<Box<EventListener>>`. Some of
    them may need to mutate a state, some others may not.

    If you define the trait method with `&mut self`, then the `Notifier` _must_
    store them in a `Vec<Rc<RefCell<Box<EventListener>>>>`, and _always_
    [mutably borrow][borrow_mut] the `RefCell` (which is not free) to call
    `on_event()` on it, for all listeners.

    [borrow_mut]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.borrow_mut

    To avoid this extra-cost, it is better to let the listeners borrow only when
    necessary.

    Ad patterns,

    > The borrowing rules constrain encapsulation.

    Actually, the rules mainly constrain composition *without* encapsulation. In
    the first case since you are providing accessors to the data members, it is
    not actually encapsulated. The internals of the struct are exposed and the
    methods don't get a chance to enforce any invariants. Effectively, it is
    exactly as if you left the data members public.

    That's what the borrow checker does not like. But if it was actually
    encapsulated, each method would do a complete operation and that would not
    leave any outstanding borrow, so there would be no problem.

    Also, unlike Java, in Rust the type is *not* a unit of encapsulation. Only
    the module is. So adding internal getters is a Java habit that does not
    translate well to Rust, but it is not really about encapsulation.

    Here there does not seem to be any problem—except for the type inference
    deficiency—until you try to add a method to the observer to register itself.

    And there I'd argue that rust does not like this because it does not really
    make sense. A method is supposed to take arguments and do some operation on
    the invocant. However, the `register_to` is trying to put reference to the
    instance somewhere and that is not responsibility of the type itself, it is
    responsibility of its owner.

    Rust is more opinionated about owners, so it makes this hard. But I think it
    is not really a good idea in Java either. It should be in the owning module
    or the owning object and there you should have the `Rc<RefCell<…>>`
    available.

    By the way, regarding the inference, I'd probably just declare `type
    EventListener = Fn(u32)` and not create a custom trait. Java didn't have
    closures until recently, so the usual approach was to create special
    interface for each observer, but in languages that do have them (including
    C#, C++ etc.) the usual style is to just declare what signature is needed
    and use standard function-objects.

    > Actually, the rules mainly constrain composition *without* encapsulation.

    In my opinion, the rules are "annoying" (and unexpected, at first) when
    encapsulation is involved: returning something lifetime-bound to a part of a
    struct from a method expands the borrow to the whole struct.

    > In the first case since you are providing accessors to the data members,
    > it is not actually encapsulated.

    Using mutable references to the fields is the minimal way to show the
    problem, but it also applies to cases were actual data fields may not be
    exposed:

    {% highlight rust %}
    pub struct Data {
        header: [u8; 4],
        payload: [u8; 20],
    }

    pub struct Header<'a> {
        raw: &'a mut [u8],
    }

    impl Data {
        pub fn header(&mut self) -> Header {
            Header { raw: &mut self.header }
        }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

    > Effectively, it is exactly as if you left the data members public.

    I'd argue that even exposing methods returning mutable references to fields
    is a form of encapsultation: the struct layout is hidden and it is possible
    to change it without breaking the API, so it's different from leaving the
    data members public.

    For instance, I may internally refactor my `Data` struct this way without
    the callers being affected:

    {% highlight rust %}
    struct Data {
        meta: Meta,
        content: ([u8; 20], String),
    }

    struct Meta {
        id: u32,
        header: [u8; 4],
    }

    impl Data {
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {
                meta: Meta { id: 0, header: [0; 4] },
                content: ([0; 20], String::new()),
            }
        }

        pub fn header(&mut self) -> &mut [u8] {
            &mut self.meta.header
        }

        pub fn payload(&mut self) -> &mut [u8] {
            &mut self.content.0
        }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

    The boundaries are just not the same: adding getters is still useful to
    expose data to another module.

    Here is the concrete case. In Gnirehtet, in case a poll event concerns a TCP
    stream receiving some data, the TCP connection builds an IP packet and send
    it to the client that opened this TCP stream. But when the client buffer is
    full, it [registers itself] to the client so that the client will pull the
    data when its buffer has space for the packet.

    [registers itself]: https://github.com/Genymobile/gnirehtet/blob/v2.0/relay-rust/src/relay/tcp_connection.rs#L304

    Calling `addSomethingListener(this)` is very (very) common in Java
    (especially on Android): just grep `add.*Listener(this)` on any Android
    application having UI.

    Thanks for making this available!  I was able to install it on an
    android tablet (as such it does not come with "USB tether" option) and I
    was able to get get wifi access from my linux laptop.  Good!

    Actually I want to use your tool to do wired vnc, but I'm a network
    newbie and I'd be most appreciative for your help on the details.

    What I want is to my tablet as a vnc display for my tablet, but my work
    place would not allow wifi/bluetooth connection so I need to use USB.
    With gnirehtet I am able to reverse tether into the laptop.

    Question:  How do I determine the address/port of the connection so I
    can enter that info the vnc viewer?  I tried running the app "network
    discovery" after I started the gnirehtet connection but the app could
    not find the address.  I also run "su ifconfig -a" from terminal
    emulator (on the tablet) but I got a dozen entries and I could not
    figure out which is which.

    I realize that this is an "off-label" use of your tool, but it would
    extremely helpful for my work.  Your help and comments are most welcome.
    THANKS!
